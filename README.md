# Rock-Paper-Scissors-app
This is my third application where I continue to deeper my understanding of JavaScript. I have put together another app using pure JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. This is a Rock Paper Scissors game that allows a user to choose rock, paper, or scissors. Then the JavaScript function also randomly makes a selection. After the choices are compared and the winner displayed to the screen.

# Summary
This app really gave me th oppurtunity to really dive into what is going on behind the scenes and gain a better understanding of JavaScript as a whole. This game takes a user input by collecting the id of a clicked image, compares that to the computers randomly generated choice, and then displays the results to the screen. The user can play as many times as they like. I had sp much fun working on this application!
